* Minghao is now a research assistant in the Key Lab of Transportation Tunnel Engineering of Chinese Ministry of Education at [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://english.swjtu.edu.cn/). With the supervisor [Dr. Wenbo Yang](http://userweb.swjtu.edu.cn/userweb/ywb1179/english.htm), he is conducting a research project into the dynamic response of tunnel and surrounding soil under long-term loads induced by trains, supported by NSF-China.
* Minghao received his B.E. in Civil Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2019.
* Minghao attended the national project "Research on interface characteristics of sprayed concrete and rock in high temperature and low relative humidity" as a research assistant in Engineering Material Lab and his advisor is [Dr.Cui](http://userweb.swjtu.edu.cn/Userweb/cuishengai/english.html).
* His research interests now include soil-structure interaction (especially in the tunnel) and soil modification by chemicals and other admixtures. Also, he is interested in how to solve the engineering problem by computer.
