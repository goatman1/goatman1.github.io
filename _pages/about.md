* Minghao is now a research assistant in [the Key Lab of Transportation Tunnel Engineering of Chinese Ministry of Education](https://tte.swjtu.edu.cn/showlist.aspx?othernum=09) at [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://english.swjtu.edu.cn/). With the supervisor [Dr. Wenbo Yang](http://userweb.swjtu.edu.cn/userweb/ywb1179/english.htm), he is conducting a research project into the dynamic response of tunnel and surrounding soil under long-term loads induced by trains, supported by NSF-China.
* Minghao received his B.E. in Civil Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2019.
* Minghao was in SWJTU Steel Bridge Team and won the first prize in display and overall fifth place in the ASCE MIDPAC 2018 Steel Bridge Competition. 
* Minghao attended the national project "Research on interface characteristics of sprayed concrete and rock in high temperature and low relative humidity" as a laboratory assistant in SWJTU Civil Engineering Material Lab and his advisor is [Dr.Cui](http://userweb.swjtu.edu.cn/Userweb/cuishengai/english.htm).
* His research interests include the dynamic response of soil and structure, soil-structure interaction (especially in the tunnel) and structure health monitoring (nondestructive methods). Also, he is interested in how to solve the engineering problem by computer programming.
